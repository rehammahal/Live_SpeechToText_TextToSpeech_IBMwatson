# Live_SpeechToText_TextToSpeech_IBMwatson

This repo is to convert the speech to text and text to speech by using IBM WATSON and Python language.

First, I set up STT IBM Watson, TTS IBM Watson, and install Python 3.9.6.

Then I clone Live STT Code from here: https://github.com/IBM/watson-streaming-stt

After that I follow my colleague instructions [Asma](https://github.com/AsmaAbdullah1998) in [her repository](https://github.com/AsmaAbdullah1998/Live--Speech-to-Text-and-Text-to-Speech-)
